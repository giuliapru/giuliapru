Hi, I’m @giuliapru, nice to see you here! 

I’m an Astrophysics PhD student at the University of Edinburgh, I'm interested in simulating galaxy and gas evolution. Do you want to know how I have fun with data? Look here: https://github.com/giuliapru/astrostatistics_bicocca_2022/tree/main/working. 👩‍💻

If you can't fly you can reach me at this e-mail address: giulia.pruto@ed.ac.uk or g.pruto@campus.unimib.it  🐦
