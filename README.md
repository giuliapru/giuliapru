Hi, I’m @giuliapru, nice to see you here! 

I’m an Astrophysics student at the University of Milano Bicocca, I'm interested in cosmology, galaxy formation and evolution. Do you want to know how I have fun with data? Look here: https://github.com/giuliapru/astrostatistics_bicocca_2022/tree/main/working. 👩‍💻
